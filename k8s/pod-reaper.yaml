  # Run a simple command via our runtime (containerd will invoke the runtime to start the process).
  # For dummy apps, we just run a native binary (sh) to echo and sleep.
  # Note: This relies on the node having /bin/sh available and the runtime parsing process.args.
  # In a full OCI setup, you'd provide a bundle; for demo we assume process args are provided by containerd.
